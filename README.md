## Just a little bit to get your day started...

Let's practice some HTML! You're going to code the HTML for a website about your favorite movies and books.

1 In your development directory, create a new html file called `favorites.html`

2 Make sure your page has doctype, head, title, and body tags

3 You'll want to include two lists: one for favorite books and one for favorite movies

4 For each movie and book, include an image.

5 Make each image a link to the imdb page for that movie or book

***BONUS***

See if you can embed a video for each movie of the movie trailer.
